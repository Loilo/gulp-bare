# gulp-bare
`gulp-bare` is as simple scaffolding tool for small gulp projects.
It's capable of setting up a JavaScript, CSS and HTML precompiler for you through a Yeoman-like command line Q&A session.

It's probably not suited to build real apps but I use it regularly for fiddling around with code or for writing small JS libraries.

Just install -- I do recommend to install globally -- with `npm i -g gulp-bare` and run `gulp-bare` from the commandline in the directory you want to set your app up.

That's pretty mutch it.

## What are the capabilities?

You will be asked for several things to set up in the following order. Each of them is optional:

### Styles
You need a CSS precompiler? Go for it. It also includes `autoprefixer` in case you want to use it.

### Scripts
Same goes for JavaScript. Will also offer to use `browserify`.

### Views
In case you also want to use a view compiler like Jade or HAML.

### Assets
This isn't exactly a precompiler. It's just a copy-and-paste tool to bring everything from source to dist path that hasn't been done by the above compilers.

With that in mind, my usual mini project structure looks like this:
```
my-app
/src
  /js
  /css
  index.html
/dst
  everything here is generated by gulp-bare
```

## Change project settings
If you want to change your style / script / view / asset settings you can just run `gulp-bare` again. It will prefill your answers with your last choices.
Though it's probably faster to just edit the `config.json` that has been created in your app's root directory.

## Why no Yeoman?
I didn't make this a Yeoman generator as for almost everything one doesn't use a framework for -- it was intended to be way smaller than it came out and I didn't feeld to be in need of one.
